COMP 4102 - Assignment 3, Question 2
March 31, 2016

Question 1 was compiled and tested using OpenCV 2.4, I was unable to compile it using OpenCV 3.1.  Question 2 however, has the opposite problem and worked for OpenCV 3.1 but not 2.4.  If there are any complications while compiling I would be glad to come show my work.

Please refer to Calibration for the source code required for question 1).
